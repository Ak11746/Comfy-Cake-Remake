## About The Project
`Purble Place: Comfy Cake` is the first game I ever played and this might also be true for the majority of you. This game holds a truly special place in my heart and thus when I got the opportunity to create a project game in python– which would also be my first full size game– for my assisment I decided to make a recreation of it. This is definately not perfect as I had to do this under 19 hours 47 min and 13 sec– true to vs-code's runtime– due to time constraints so don't be offended and enjoy the nostalgic recollection of cool evening and warm afternoons we gave to this game– haha, being dramatic. I hove you enjoy this recreation.

## Dependencies

The code depends upon the following external libraries in adition to the basic python libraries:
- keyboard : `pip install keyboard`
- prettytable : `pip install prettytable`
>**Important:**
> Absence of these dependencies will create random errors.
